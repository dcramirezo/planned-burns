# planned-burns

The project was design to create a functional prototype that will help the department to incorporate the different stages of Planned Burns with information on past, current and future burns in a more user-friendly and accessible mapping tool. This will hopefully provide the department with an overview of what the community needs to get easily inform through a better experience when identifying current burns around their locations, as well as, an interactive and educational overview of the reasons behind these burns.
